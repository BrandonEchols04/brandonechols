           Hi, I'm Brandon Echols and this is <i>The Wild Mind</i>. That is, you'll find a bunch of sentiments from my wild mind right here. Having an interest in many subsets of life, you'll find a variety of things coveredâ€”writing, music, religion, D&D, genealogy, photography, and more!
         </p>
         <p>
           At the top of the page, you'll see three tabs. The <b>Blog</b> tab is where you'll find all of my random thoughts and musings.
         </p>
         <p>
           In <b>Projects</b>, you might find a variety of links to projects I'm working on and projects I've finished (however seldom that occurs).
         </p>
         <p>
           Within <b>Collections</b>, you navigate through various collections of my poetry, music, etc.
         </p>
         <p>
           Under the <b>Photos</b> tab, you can peruse a gallery of photographs that I have captured. The newest images will appear near the top.
         </p>
