          Hi, I'm Brandon Echols and this is <i>Notes from the Wild Mind</i>. That is, you'll find a bunch of sentiments from <i>my</i> <b>wild</b> mind here.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the top of the page, you'll see three tabs. The <b>Blog</b> tab is where you'll find all of my random thoughts and musings.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <b>Projects</b>, you might find a variety of linksâ€”projects I'm working on, projects I've finished (however seldom that occurs), and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the <b>Photos</b> tab, you can peruse a gallery of photographs that I have captured. The newest images will appear near the top.
        </p>
